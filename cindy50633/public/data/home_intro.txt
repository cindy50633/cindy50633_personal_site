Hello, I'm Cindy, coming from Taiwan!

I am good at python,
especially deal with data calculation by python.

I am still not a pro, but on my way to pro!

By the way, I majored in physics during my college.
Thus, you might find out some interesting physics knowledge in some hidden places.
Try to find out all of them!
